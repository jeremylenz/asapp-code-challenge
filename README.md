This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Here's my submission for the Frontend Code Challenge!

#### Setup

After cloning the repo, type the following command in the Terminal:

```
yarn install
```

After installation is complete, start the app by typing

```
yarn start
```

The app will load at `http://localhost:3000`.
