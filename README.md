This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Here's my submission for the Frontend Code Challenge!

#### Setup

After cloning the repo, type the following command in the Terminal:

```
yarn install
```

After installation is complete, start the app by typing

```
yarn start
```

The app will load at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Features

* iMessage-style split-screen chat
* Sent messages show in purple; received messages in grey
* Typing indicator shows if a user has been typing in the last 3 seconds
* Chat window automatically scrolls to bottom (uses `react-scroll` library)
* Styling done with `semantic-ui-react` with custom CSS added
